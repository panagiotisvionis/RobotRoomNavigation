# RobotRoomNavigation ü§ñ

**Arduino Robot with Dual Functionality**  
This project implements two autonomous behaviors for a mobile robot using an Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and DC motors with an L298N motor driver.

---

## üöÄ Features

1. **Corridor Following (CORRIDOR_FOLLOW):**  
   The robot stays centered between two walls using left and right distance measurements.

2. **Room Navigation and Exit (ROOM_NAVIGATION):**  
   The robot moves inside a room, follows the wall, detects a doorway, and exits through it once the opening is verified.

## üîß Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO  
- 1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- 1x Servo Motor (SG90 or similar)  
- 2x DC Motors  
- L298N Motor Driver Module  
- Battery pack (6V‚Äì12V recommended)  
- Jumper wires and chassis

## üß† How It Works

- The **ultrasonic sensor** is mounted on a **servo** which rotates to collect distances from left, center, and right.
- Using this data, the robot adjusts motor speeds to follow the corridor center or detect walls and doorways.
- The behavior is determined by the variable:

```cpp
OperationMode currentMode = ROOM_NAVIGATION;
```

Change it to:

```cpp
OperationMode currentMode = CORRIDOR_FOLLOW;
```

if you want to test the corridor-following behavior instead.
